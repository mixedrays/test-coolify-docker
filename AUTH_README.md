# Enhanced Authentication System

## Overview
The `/protected` endpoint now features an enhanced authentication system that supports both existing user login and automatic account creation.

## How It Works

### For Existing Users
- Users with existing accounts can log in with their username and password as before
- Passwords are now properly hashed using bcrypt for security

### For New Users
- If you don't have an account, simply enter a new username and password in the browser authentication dialog
- The system will automatically create a new account with your credentials
- You'll be immediately granted access to the protected area

### Browser Dialog
When you visit `/protected`:
1. Your browser will show a native authentication dialog
2. Enter your username and password
3. If the account exists and password is correct → Access granted
4. If the account doesn't exist → New account created automatically → Access granted
5. If the account exists but password is wrong → Access denied with helpful error message

## Security Features
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Clear error messages help distinguish between wrong passwords and account creation
- Protection against duplicate usernames
- Timestamps for account creation tracking

## API Response
The protected endpoint now returns JSON with:
- Welcome message
- Access count
- Timestamp
- Confirmation message about authentication/account creation

## Testing
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/protected`
2. Try with existing credentials (e.g., `testuser`/`testpass`)
3. Try with new credentials to create a new account
4. Try with existing username but wrong password to see error handling

## Database Schema
Users table includes:
- `id`: Primary key
- `username`: Unique username
- `password`: Bcrypt hashed password
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp
